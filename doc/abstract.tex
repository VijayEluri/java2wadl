The purpose of this article is to examine the \emph{Representational State Transfer} architectural style, the \emph{Web Application Description Language} and how these technologies compare to SOAP/WSDL.

In the end a Java library called \emph{Java2Wadl2Java}, which covers a large subset of the WADL and JAX-RS specifications, will be presented. This library allows to generate WADL resources based on Java-types (i.e. Java-classes) as well as Java class-stubs for WADL-files and thus provides means for a full WADL/JAX-RS life-cycle.
